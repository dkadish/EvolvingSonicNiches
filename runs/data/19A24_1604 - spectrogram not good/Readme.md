# Significance
First run to with spectrogram data for encoders.

# Parameters
Activation
:  sigmoid

Initial Connection
:  unconnected

Individuals
:  50

Generations
:  25

# Ideas
Try without penalties for non-member signals. Just ignore them.

# Notes
It seems like the encoders are simply not forming connections.
I'm going to try partial direct connections on the encoders to start.
