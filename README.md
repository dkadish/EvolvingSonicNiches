Documentation for Evolving Niches
===========================================

This (very incomplete) documentation covers the code used for a series of experiments
in artificial life and soundscape formation over the course of my PhD.
The results of the experiments are publishd in two papers:

 * Kadish, D., Risi, S., & Beloff, L. (2019). An artificial life approach to studying niche differentiation in soundscape ecology. The 2019 Conference on Artificial Life, 52–59. https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00140
 * Kadish, D., & Risi, S. (2020). Adapting to a changing environment: Simulating the effects of noise on animal sonification. The 2020 Conference on Artificial Life, 687–695. https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00320

This code covers the experimental runs and portions of the analysis that was done in creating the paper.
